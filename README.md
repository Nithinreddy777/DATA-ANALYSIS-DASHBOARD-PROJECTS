## Project Insights

The analysis shows that revenue is not evenly distributed across product categories, with a small number of categories contributing the majority of total sales. Monthly profit trends indicate clear fluctuations, suggesting the presence of seasonal demand patterns rather than consistent growth. Geographic analysis highlights that certain states generate high sales volume but do not always translate into high profit, indicating margin inefficiencies. Payment method analysis reveals a dominant customer preference for specific payment modes, which can be leveraged to improve checkout optimization and promotions.

# Final Conclusion

This project demonstrates how an Excel-based interactive dashboard can effectively convert raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights. By identifying top-performing categories, regions, and payment methods, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making and highlights areas for improving profitability and operational focus.
